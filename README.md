<h1 align="center">Lure</h1>
<p align="center"><em>A modern Minecraft Layer 4 proxy and load balancer built with Rust, Tokio, and Valence.</em></p>

---

## Overview

**Lure** is a sophisticated, but lightweight enough, high-performance Layer 4 (L4) proxy for Minecraft.
It reach high performance with

- Fast tokio socket polling
- Fast first-handshake deserialization
- Async session handling

### Performance

Gate vs Lure, tested from VN to SG, with Wifi latency. 

![Gate: 96ms; Lure: 16ms](/assets/thicc.png)

<sub>*Lure actually give off uneven result with random spike, while Gate keeps a stable number, a quite lower than the peak of Lure</sub>

## Philosophy

Multi-tenancy design model, that to using well serialized configuration not config-generation and reloading
(which prone gimmick at scale)

Gate(lite), which is a mature proxy for this purpose, but I wasn't able to make it work on this model.

## Features

- Provision with an API backend for orchestration (via RPC, see [Elysia implementation](https://github.com/hUwUtao/Lucky))
- Multi-server & multi-host support
- Proxy Protocol (supported Paper-derived, Velocity and Bungeecord)
- Highly observable system through OTEL
- Global threat control (WIP), with socket ratelimit, etc.

### Cutting edge

Future proof features, with considerations that some "unsafe" are fine. Project is using rustfmt nightly.
To extends features like runtime monitoring \(I have some jealousy with go that they have actually mature otlp).

### The coldest process

Optional [mimalloc](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc) crate feature allocator reduces CPU usage (4% â†’ 1%) at the
cost of higher memory usage (~47MiB vs ~20MiB).

### Incompatibility

- [x] Client are disconnected after a while: The client will timeout. Tolerate handshake for bit longer. Seems like working!

- [x] **FIXED**, Known gimmick to actual protocol-use is `viaproxy`. On 1.20.6 server, there such a behavior of packet disorder 
suspected because of async polling (or kind of?)

> Update: ViaVersion has an update.

- [ ] Does not connect well when native condition of Distant Horizon paper support is met. Currently investigating.

- [ ] "TL\*uncher Guard" (suspected) flatten hostname to ip. Result is mixed of people with TL\*ncher
